# Space Turtle: Typing Game!

A typing game where the user must type the words shown on screen in a limited amount of time. There is a turtle (representing the player) in the middle of the screen, and there will be monsters approaching the turtle from the edges of the screen. The monsters have words underneath. The player must type and enter the monsters' words to destroy them before they reach the turtle.

## Features:
* Digitally drawn graphics, including a turtle representing the player, aliens representing the enemies, and a space-themed background
* A screen for instructions
* Animations (aliens travelling towards the player from the edges)
* 700 possible words for the player to type, from 3 - 9 letters long
* A life system (where the player gets 5 lives)
* A scoring system (with high scores retained each time the game is played)
* Four difficulty levels that differ in terms of word lengths, frequency of aliens, and speed of aliens (each difficulty level still increases in difficulty as the game goes on)
